#Problem 1

'''
Write a function called decode_whale_speak. This function will read through a string and remove any letters(characters) that are neighbors and the same.
This function may NOT use any loops, only recursion. The function should ultimately return the final value of the string as a non-whale speaker can understand it


e.g.
pizza -> piza
mississippi -> misisipi
world -> world
hhhhhoooowwww aaaaarrrrreeeee yyyyyooooouuuuuu ddddoooooiiiiiiinnnnngggg? -> how are you doing?
